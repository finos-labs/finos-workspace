# Running the FINOS Workspace locally for development

Everything for working on the app on your own machine lives in this folder. One command starts the frontend, the backend API and its worker, MySQL and Valkey, and code edits show up without restarting anything.

To run the built images instead (web app and API, as a user would), use `docker-compose.yml` at the repository root; its [README section](../README.md#running-the-whole-stack) explains it. The two stacks use port 8000, so run one at a time.

## Before you start

- Docker Desktop, running, with at least 8 GB of memory for Docker (Settings, Resources).
- Ports 3306, 6379, 8000 and 1420 free.
- `make`, which comes with macOS (Xcode command line tools) and Linux. On Windows, use WSL.
- `python3`, only the first time and only its standard library: it writes the settings.

Nothing else: the backend and Node run inside the containers.

## Start

```sh
cd local
ADMIN_EMAIL=<your-email> make up
```

`ADMIN_EMAIL` names the first administrator. It is needed only while `backend-api/backend/envs/.env` does not exist; the first `make up` creates that file with random secrets, and `backend-api/backend/scripts/cfgs/config.toml` with the organization and the administrator's address. Both files are yours: neither is for git. Later runs only need `make up`.

The first run builds the backend images and installs the frontend packages, so it takes several minutes. Later runs reuse the images and start much faster. `make up` waits until the app answers and then prints where to go:

- App: <http://localhost:1420>
- Backend: <http://localhost:8000>
- Sign in as the administrator in `backend-api/backend/scripts/cfgs/config.toml`, with the password that you set in the next step.

## Set the administrator's password

The `init` step creates the administrator without a password, so set it once, before the first sign-in. Run this in this folder while the stack is running:

```sh
docker compose run --rm init python -m scripts.init_users --new-password <your-email>
```

It asks for the password twice and does not show it. The same command sets a new password and ends every session of the account. The password is in the database, so `make down`, `make up` and a restart of Docker keep it. `make reset` deletes the database, and then you run the command again.

## Commands

Run these in this folder, or from the repo root as `make -C local <command>`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make up` | Checks your machine, builds, starts everything and waits until the app answers |
| `make down` | Stops everything and keeps the data |
| `make logs` | Follows all logs; `make logs s=backend` follows one service |
| `make ps` | Shows what is running |
| `make restart s=<service>` | Restarts one service |
| `make shell s=<service>` | Opens a shell in a service (default: `backend`) |
| `make reset` | Deletes the local database and frontend packages, then starts again |
| `make doctor` | Checks Docker, Docker Compose and the ports without starting anything |

Without `make`, use Docker Compose directly from this folder: `docker compose up --build -d`, `docker compose down`, `docker compose logs -f` and so on, after `./dev.sh env` has written the settings once.

## What runs

| Service | Port | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend` | 1420 | Vite dev server for `frontend/` |
| `backend` | 8000 | FastAPI app from `backend-api/backend/` |
| `backend-worker` | | Background jobs (RQ), same code as the backend |
| `init` | | Runs once per start: database migrations, then the administrator and the organization |
| `mysql` | 3306 | Database, user `root`, password `root`, database `workspace` |
| `valkey` | 6379 | Cache and job queue |

## Making changes

- Frontend code: the browser reloads on save.
- Backend code: the API restarts itself on save.
- Worker code: the worker does not reload; run `make restart s=backend-worker`.
- Database migrations: `init` applies new ones on every `make up`.
- Python dependencies (`pyproject.toml`): `make up` rebuilds the backend images.
- Frontend dependencies (`package.json`): `make restart s=frontend` runs `npm install` again.

## Settings

The backend reads `backend-api/backend/envs/.env`, the same file the root `docker-compose.yml` uses. `scripts.create_local_env` writes it from `envs/.env.example` and changes these values:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `MODE` | `production` | The value the root `docker-compose.yml` runs with; `compose.yaml` sets `local` for this stack (Widget plugins) |
| `SELFURL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Links the backend builds point at the API |
| `DB_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST` | `mysql`, `valkey` | The container names |
| `DB_NAME` | `workspace` | The database the MySQL container creates |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | `folder` | Uploaded files go to `backend-api/backend/local_storage/` instead of cloud storage |
| `JWT_SECRET`, `WORKSPACE_AES_KEY`, `WORKSPACE_AUTH_TOKEN`, `LOCAL_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` | generated | `WORKSPACE_AUTH_TOKEN` is a JWT signed with `JWT_SECRET`; the example leaves them blank, and the API refuses to start without strong values |
| `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000`, `:1420` | The origins of the web app: the root `docker-compose.yml`'s and this stack's dev server |

`compose.yaml` sets `MODE` to `local`, and overrides `FRONTENDURL` and `APPURL` with `http://localhost:1420`, the address of the dev server, so links and redirects point at it. The dev server on another port reaches the API because `http://localhost:1420` is one of `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`. An MCP server on your machine or network that the API should reach goes in `ALLOWED_MCP_HOSTNAMES` (see `envs/.env.example`).

Edit `envs/.env` freely, then `make restart s=backend`. To get a fresh one, delete it, and `config.toml` next to it, and run `ADMIN_EMAIL=<your-email> make up`; if the database already holds the old administrator, run `make reset` instead.

The frontend uses `frontend/.env`, except that `compose.yaml` points the backend and AI URLs at `localhost`.

A new backend setting needs adding in more places than this folder: `envs/.env.example` for local runs, and the values of every environment you deploy to.

## Widget plugins

Widget plugins are packages built outside this repository (see the documentation site, How to build and try a widget plugin). Nothing installs from the app: on your own stack you are the deployer and the administrator. This stack runs with `MODE=local`, so you can also develop a new version of an approved plugin in place, which no deployment allows.

1. Pick a directory on your machine for packages. In `compose.yaml`, give the `backend` service its own `volumes`. They replace the shared ones, so keep the source mount. The plugins directory is writable here, so that the app can start a new version in it:

   ```yaml
   backend:
     volumes:
       - ../backend-api/backend:/opt/code
       - <plugins directory>:/opt/widget-plugins
   ```

   In `envs/.env`, set `WIDGET_PLUGINS_DIR=/opt/widget-plugins`. Then `make up`: a new mount needs the container recreated, which `make restart` does not do.
2. Build the plugin into `<plugins directory>/<plugin-id>/<version>/`, with its `plugin.json`.
3. Check it with the server's own validator, from `backend-api/backend`: `python -m scripts.plugin_check <plugins directory>/<plugin-id>/<version>`. `--digest` prints the checksum for the manifest and the version digest.
4. Sign in as the administrator, open Admin, Widgets, Deployment: Rescan, review what the version asks for, approve it, and enable it for your organization. Under Plugin widgets, enable it, and under Roles and Access grant it to a role you hold: a role is the only way to a plugin. `python -m scripts.workspace_admin plugin ...`, run in the backend container, does the same from a terminal.
5. To change the plugin, open its Deployment page and choose Patch, Minor or Major. The app copies the active version to `<plugins directory>/<plugin-id>/<next version>/` and serves that copy from its files as they are: edit them or build into the directory, and a dashboard picks the change up when its window gets focus. When it is done, write its `checksum` (`plugin_check --digest`, or your build) and approve it, or commit the directory and open a pull request. An approved version is never edited: changing its files blocks it.
6. A plugin that calls a keyed service through a proxy needs its secret: set it on the plugin's page under Deployment (the value is never shown again), or put it in a file `<secrets directory>/<plugin-id>/<secret-name>`, add `- <secrets directory>:/run/secrets/widget-plugins:ro` to the `backend` volumes of step 1, and set `WIDGET_PLUGIN_SECRETS_DIR=/run/secrets/widget-plugins`. The API refuses to call an address that is not public, which includes your own machine: to let a plugin reach a service there, override its server network on the same page and confirm private hosts. A service whose certificate your own authority signs needs that authority's file mounted and named by `WIDGET_PLUGIN_PROXY_CA_FILE`.

### A deployed data backend

A widget can read a data backend that a deployment uses: add it under Connections with your own key, read-only where the backend has such keys, and have the backend allow `http://localhost:1420` as an origin. The browser calls it directly, and this stack has its own database, so nothing is written to the deployment's FINOS Workspace. A deployment's agent and plugin backends accept only that deployment's sessions and call tokens; run them on your machine instead (the root `docker-compose.yml` runs the agent, `docs/examples/sql-explorer/examples/compose.yaml` a plugin backend).

## What does not work locally

- AI features. They need an AI service, which this setup does not run; `AI_API_URL` stays empty and `AI_COPILOT_ENABLED` stays `false`. The root `docker-compose.yml` runs Ines, the FINOS Workspace's agent.
- Google sign-in, unless `http://localhost:1420` is an allowed origin of the Google OAuth client. Use the email sign-in.

## Differences from a deployed environment

- Plain `http://localhost` with one port per service, instead of HTTPS hostnames behind a load balancer.
- The frontend runs the Vite dev server instead of the nginx image, which writes its settings into `config.js` at start.
- One copy of each service.
- MySQL with the password `root` and Valkey without a password, both without TLS.
- The backend images are built for `linux/amd64`, like the ones deployed; on Apple silicon set `PLATFORM=linux/arm64` (for example `PLATFORM=linux/arm64 make up`) to build for the host.

## Troubleshooting

- `make doctor` says a port is in use: stop whatever holds it (the message prints the `lsof` command that shows it), or stop another stack. The root `docker-compose.yml` stack also uses port 8000: `docker compose down` there.
- `make up` stops with "the init step failed": `make logs s=init` shows why.
- The app loads but login fails: `make logs s=backend` shows the request and the error.
- Start from scratch: `make reset`. This deletes the local database.
